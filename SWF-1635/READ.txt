====> Project1 folder

It's a SWF 2.3 example downloaded from original source spring code. I've added a new flow folder called 'common' on '/WEB-INF/jsp' in which I handle

NotMatchingTranslationException. This handler not working and browser return 404 error.


=====> Project2 folder

It's a custom SWF 2.4.1.RC1, JSF2, Primefaces example. Now, NotMatchingTranslationException works properly but when you click several times  over a unknow transition and then you click on a know transition the flow is gone and usually you must click again. NotMatchingTranslationException is handled on 'commons-header' folder on '/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/flows'
